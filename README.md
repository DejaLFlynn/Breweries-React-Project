# Breweries

![Breweries]()




# Motivation:
Years ago I declared that Philadelphia was one of my favorite cities and one of my list of to do's in life are to visit more breweries.  Using the Open Breweries API I wanted to create a map of my next adventures. 


For fun I created a web platform where individuals could have a list that should display the following information for each brewery, Name, Type, Address (Street, City, State, Zip), Website URL (clickable)
